      <p>
        I'm a Systems and Computing Engineering student at UPTC, currently in
        the final stage of my academic training. I've worked with technologies
        like <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Spring Boot</strong>,
        <strong>Angular</strong>, and <strong>Python</strong> — always focusing
        on data handling in both SQL and NoSQL environments.

        I'm actively seeking an
        <strong>internship or professional placement</strong> where I can apply
        my knowledge, grow my skills, and contribute to building
        <strong>functional and scalable tech solutions</strong>.

        Inspired by parrots — their learning, adaptability, and observation — I
        approach challenges with <strong>curiosity</strong>,
        <strong>focus</strong>, and <strong>creativity</strong> to find stable
        and efficient solutions.
